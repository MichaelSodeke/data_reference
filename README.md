Challenge: 
	Try to bring something new to the table: 
		+doesn't have to be big (though it can definitely be if you want it to)
		+example: showing how to do a list comprehension
				aList = [x for x in range(1,10,2)]
		+a dataset you thought was interesting
		+a statistical technique
		+an interesting library
		+a programming, math, or stats book you think is a good read; especially
		 if they're at the intro-level for people unfamiliar with certain concepts
     +a handy website that you like to use as reference, etc.
